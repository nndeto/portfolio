# Welcome!
If you're here, that means you viewed my portfolio and for that I'm so thankful. I appreciate the time you took, and if you're still curious, feel free to take a look at the code behind my portfolio.

I'm thrilled to have built my portfolio from scratch because it not only provided a much needed refresher on vanilla HTML, JS, and CSS, but it also allowed me to feel like I completed a mini-project.

# Triumphs
Experimenting with media queries to make my portfolio responsive across different devices and successfully doing so was a win. 
Implementing a vertical and fixed navbar was something I tried for the first time with, and I learned a lot by playing with different css properties. 

# Challenges
Deciding on an overall layout and design aesthetic proved difficult because I didn't want to use a template. Once I found some inspiration though, I was able to hit the ground running.
