# Triumphs
Experimenting with media queries to make my portfolio responsive across different devices and successfully doing so was a win. 
Implementing a vertical and fixed navbar was something I tried for the first time with, and I learned a lot through playing with different css properties. 

# Challenges
Deciding on an overall layout and design aesthetic proved difficult because I didn't want to use a template. Once I found some inspiration though, I was able to hit the ground running.
